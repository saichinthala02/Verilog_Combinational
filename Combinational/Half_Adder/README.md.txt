# Verilog Combinational Circuits

This repository contains combinational circuit designs implemented in Verilog HDL.  
Currently included:

## Half Adder
- Implemented in all three models: **Dataflow**, **Behavioral**, and **Structural**.  
- Testbench included (`half_adder_tb.v`).  
- Simulation script included (`run.do`).  


## Notes
- Only one model (Structural) is active by default.  
- Uncomment the Dataflow or Behavioral modules in the design file to simulate them.  
- Modular and reusable design for learning Verilog modeling styles.
